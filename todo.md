# TODO

- Finish writing resampler pipeline ops
- Consider if want to use tf.data.Dataset (probably?)
- Write test case in Jupyter of resampler creating / operating on dataset
- Write a few dataset methods:
    - 1. Load all images and match arrays to typing
    - 2. Convert previous into tf.dataset and apply image manip ops
    - 3. Undo image manips?
- Build model and pass dataset to it
- Do everything in Jupyter nb first, then move to scripts as necessary
